# rock-paper-scissiors
# This is a normal basic python project.
# I have done a common rock paper scissor game played by all.
# This is a game done by between a computer and a player.
# First the player will be given some number of chances.
# The choices will be given in a list and the player has to choose the number between them.
# After that the winner will be given a point that will be added to an empty list.
# By calculating the number of points the player and computer gets, it will return you the winner.
